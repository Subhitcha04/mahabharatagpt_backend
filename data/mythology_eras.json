          "The Dvapara Yuga is characterized by a decline in virtue and an increase in vice, yet it still retains some noble qualities. It differs from the previous Treta Yuga, which was marked by greater righteousness, and the subsequent Kali Yuga, known for its moral degradation. Significant events during the Dvapara Yuga include the Kurukshetra War, the life of Lord Krishna, and the eventual downfall of the Kauravas. The moral and ethical dilemmas faced by characters, such as the struggle between duty and righteousness, reflect the values of this era.
